The Chess game with pseudo AI is not yet complete. Current work in progress includes:
  -> Pseudo AI Algorithms: I am developing algorithms in C++ that compute 2 to 3 moves ahead and then select the best move.
  -> Graphical Representation of the Chess Board: Ongoing development to enhance the visual display of the chess board.
